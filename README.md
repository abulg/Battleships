# Battleship
C++ implementation of a battleship game in Terminal


## Future Work
If I return to this, and decide to expand, future work may include:
* Build out a set of rules for an auto-player to base intelligent gameplay on
* Add sentinel character to end the game early (right now, it will loop until someone wins)
* Add entry error protection in Game function
